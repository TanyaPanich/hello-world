We will talk after coffee

Hadn't had coffee yet.  So, mind me if I talk gibberish.

Oops, I should have said DO NOT mind me if I talk gibberish.  

See what I am talking about?

One more time...   This is bad.

:) Good morning! I was studying till 3am last night,
so coffee probably will not help me.
But I am drinking it right now anyway :)
